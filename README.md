WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF ANEURAL AUTOGNORICS ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ This site is neither about Artificial Intelligence nor Machine Learning. This is all about a new higher school of thought that deals with creating engineered life forms,
machines, things, and systems through Intuitive objects, Embedded Inscriptions, Reverse Inverse Theory, and Inscription by Design.

âš¡ The Revisionist Ideas:
The website introduces a new paradigm shift that redefines the essential elements that come along with the criteria of life.
Life evolves from being alive to being living, a process governed by six stages.
The Six Orders of Life:
(1)Aliveness = the ability to consume energy without the need for neural reasoning.
(2)Awareness = the ability to send and receive signals using IOs without the need for neural reasoning.
(3)Consciouness = the ability to match things with things without the need for neural reasoning.
(4)Intutiveness = the ability to choose between this or that without the need for neural reasoning.
(5)Neuralness = self-knowledge (a brain without the brain)
(6)Living = experiences life (eafthos)

âš¡ Originemology: etmology, founded, definitions,
eaftos = self
gnosei = knowledge
aftognosia = self-knowledge
zois = life-forms
autognozics = self-knowledge life-forms
Autognorics = the science of creating living machines
1988
