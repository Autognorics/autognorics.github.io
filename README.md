~WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF ANEURAL AUTOGNORICS 👋
~🌱 This is neither about Artificial Intelligence nor Machine Learning ...
⚡ This is all about a new higher school of thought that deals with creating engineered life forms,
machines, things, and systems through Intuitive objects, Embedded Inscriptions,
Reverse Inverse Theory, and Inscription by Design.
⚡ The Revisionist Ideas:
A paradigm shift that redefines the essential elements that come along with the criteria of life.
Life evolves from being alive to being living, a process governed by six stages.
The Six Orders of Life:
Aliveness = the ability to consume energy without the need for neural reasoning.
Awareness = the ability to send and receive signals using IOs without the need for neural reasoning.
Consciouness = the ability to match things with things without the need for neural reasoning.
Intutiveness = the ability to choose between this or that without the need for neural reasoning.
Neuralness = self-knowledge (a brain without the brain)
Living = experiences life (eafthos)
⚡ Originemology:
eaftos = self
gnosei = knowledge
aftognosia = self-knowledge
zois = life-forms
autognozics = self-knowledge life-forms
Autognorics = the science of creating living machines
