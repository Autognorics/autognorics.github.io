## Welcome to My Autognorics GitHub Wiki Pages
 
At the crossroads of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics lies a captivating novel discipline known as Autognorics. This field focuses on the study of in-vivo machines that exhibit life-like qualities. It deals with embedded inscriptions, intuitive objects, aneural brein memory systems, and generated interim emergence.

Autognorics emerged from the scientific research conducted by Engr Joey Lawsin in 1988 — the Biotronics Project. The project aimed to create intuitive machines that possess life. These Intuitive Machines (IM) are objects that behave and look like humans, animals, plants, or cells. They can walk, see, talk, think, hear, taste, feel, fly, swim, and yes, they can also die. 

The word Autognorics is derived from the Greek words: Auto which means self and Gnorics which means knowledge. Literally, it means " a self-knowledge living machine". 

ELFS refers to Engineered Life Forms. They are living machines endowed with the seven signatures of life. These ELFS are classified as neural (with brains) or aneural (brainless). They are also classified as Bioforms (alive, living, and with life) or Abioforms (alive, living, but without life). The new seven criteria of life presents a seven-part formula known as the Laws of Seven Inscriptions which include:

1. Mechanization of Aliveness (Alive): This involves enabling a material object to perform basic functions like movement or animation through self-energization. At this stage, the object is considered alive but lacks awareness or consciousness.
2. Sensation of Awareness (Sensors): This step involves adding sensory inputs to the object, such as vision, hearing, touch, taste, or smell. This enables the object to perceive its environment and react to stimuli. The object is now aware but not yet conscious.
3. Logic of Intuitiveness (Logic): This involves adding rational abilities to the object, such as logic, inference, or deduction through its sensors. This enables the object’s sensors to respond or make decisions based on its information inputs and outputs. The object is now intuitive but not inlearn, neural, or symbiotic.
4. Codification of Consciousness (Codex): This involves associating an object (reality) with information (ideas), such as following, copying, discovering, or mimicking what it senses. This enables the object to interact with its surroundings. The object is now conscious but not informed or inlearned.
5. Inlearness of Information (Inlearn): This involves adding learning capabilities to the object through acquiring information in a queue. The various distinct structural designs of its gnos store individual information uniquely through the flowchart effect via information inputs and outputs that create experiences, behaviors, and feedbacks. The object is now inlearn or inform but not symbiotic or self-emergent.
6. Symbiosis of Living (Living): This involves adding social interactions to the object, such as cooperation or competition. This enables the object to form relationships and networks with other objects and benefit from their resources and support. The object is now symbiotic but without self-realization, self-identity, or self-recognition yet.
7. Emergence of Self (Life): This involves adding self-referentiality to the object, such as self-identity, self-expression, or self-reflection. This enables the object to recognize itself as a distinct entity and create its own meaning and values in life. The object can now recognize itself, thoughts, feelings, actions, and experiences. 

Before we dive deeper on these seven evolutionary orders of life, let us examine first the old basic criteria of Life known to science:
 
* Living things consume food in the form of energy (eat).
* Living things take and expel gas (breathe).
* Living things are moving or in motion (perform).
* Living things reproduce with an exact copy of themselves (replicate).
* Living things grow with their surrounding environment (thrive).
* Living things respond with their sensors (sense).
* Living things are made up of cells.
 
However, there are living organisms that lack one or more of these characteristics but are still considered alive, like for example the non-cellular micro-organisms that exist without cells. The seed, a non-living thing that produces a tree, a living thing. The virus, chemical machinery, that becomes alive when living with a host. And the neuron, a non-living thing that produces awareness common to living things when confined in a network.
 
On the other hand, being Alive can also be defined according to the criteria of being dead. To be considered dead, medically, and legally, the individual has undergone:
 
* Total failure of the heart.
* Total failure of the lungs.
* Total failure of the brain stem.
 
But again, there are living organisms without brains, lungs, and hearts but are considered alive. Trees, flowers, and jellyfish do not have hearts, lungs, or even brains but are living things. Another example is the Trichoplax, an organism without organs. This living creature of the kingdom Monera can walk without feet, eat without a mouth, digest without a stomach, and reproduce without reproductive organs.

Therefore, there is really no definite criterion that defines when an object is alive. However, by deduction and elimination, one common factor that shines among our criteria is the ability of an organism to self-consume energy. In order for something to move, reproduce, react and make the heart, lungs, and brain function, it needs energy. 

Thus, when an object self-consumes energy from food, batteries, sunlight, sound, motion, or any external source of energy, such an object is ALIVE. 

In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPgEEafvwsQ&feature=emb_title), the machine is alive because it powers itself by self-consuming energy from external sources. Aside from energy, the machine becomes animated mechanically because of its structure and design. This automated mechanical self-animation is known as Animation Inscripted by Design or A.I.D.  The animation or aliveness is due through energy, animation, and inscriptions.

The machine in the video might be alive, but again it is not living or with life. When its battery receives an infinite constant flow of energy, either by solar panels or charging stations, the machine will always be in motion indefinitely much like the jellyfish ( an animal without a brain, a heart, or blood) that floats aimlessly at sea as it simply continuously reacts unknowingly with its outside world. The jellyfish is alive but without a brain (aneural), a heart (acardial), and blood (ahemial) .

On top of this, there are other creatures who are:

* alive but without brains, 
* alive but not conscious, 
* alive but not aware, 
* aware but not conscious, 
* aware but no brains, 
* conscious but not aware, and 
* conscious but not self-cognizant. 

Remember, Life is a process. It evolves from being alive to being living.
